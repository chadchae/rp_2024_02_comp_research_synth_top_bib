To assist students in this programming-based course, all TAs are all equipped with knowledge and experience in R, Python, Automated Machine Learning, and an infernal statistic toolkit. As an active research team member, his research interest covers Portfolio Management, Green Economy, Green Management, and Knowledge Sharing. Correspondingly, he has several field experiences to provide him with different perspectives for the projects. In order to diversify his view on business problems, he focused on different related fields, including an internship in the Middle East as a salesperson and the Operation Analyst in the Bankruptcy Department at a law firm. His research and internship interest is based on applying analytics in practical situations. Thus, his internship interest includes Strategic Consulting, Management Consulting, Brokerage Research, and Internet BA. His personal volunteering and coordinating experience at major events like WYSS- World Young Scientist Summit and Wenzhou Bankruptcy Representatives Association have provided communication skills and working procedures for TA tasks and managing the lab activities.\n\n\n\nJiawei Gu (Owen)\n\n\n\nowen.gujiawei@gmail.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJiawei Gu is a sophomore at Wenzhou-Kean University, majoring in Management Science. As a member in BA lab, he actively contributes to the BA lab and holds leadership roles as the head of the Academic Department of the Science and Technology Research Association and the vice president of the Student Union. His research interests are in “Work-life balance” and “Human Resource Management and Development,” areas where he has already made significant strides. Collaborating with Dr. Chad, Jiawei has co-authored a paper accepted for presentation at the AIB conference and is involved in two ongoing research projects. These initiatives reflect his commitment to exploring innovative solutions for enhancing employee well-being and organizational effectiveness. Through his academic and extracurricular activities, Jiawei demonstrates a strong dedication to his field, aiming to contribute valuable insights and foster sustainable workplace practices.\n\n\n\n\nAcknowledgement\n\nBusiness analytics lab students at Wenzhou-Kean:",
